🔲  TODO    Ignore non-alpha characters, if typed: 0-9, space, symbols !@# etc.

            Yellow Letters:
            Grey Letters:
            Results: matching words or error

⛔  WONTFIX Instead of 5-letter fields for Green and Yellow, have individual 
    1-letter fields so the user doesn't need to fuss with ..... padding.

Bugs:
🔲  TODO    If a word has a legitimate double-letter, validation needs
            to allow the second letter in yellow or grey:
            Solution:   APPLE
            Green:      AP...
            Yellow:     ...AP --⊳⊳ Error: green and yellow both contain: P

🔲  TODO    Realign the results column so "Results" label is always 
            visible (long results list pushes it too far down)

🔲  TODO    Replace TextArea with label or "content editable div"?
    🔲      Do we still need react-textarea-autosize NPM package?
